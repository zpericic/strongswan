The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>.
<b>carol</b> proposes CURVE_25519 for the key exchange and KE_FRODO_SHAKE_L5 for
the additional key exchange whereas <b>dave</b> proposes MODP_3072 and KE_FRODO_AES_L3,
respectively.

Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown script
automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
